This work  is to develop and evaluate a sentiment analysis model. Sentiment analysis is the task of natural language processing which aims to predict whether a piece of text is
associated with a positive or negative sentiment.
I use the text representation to build a machine learning model for text classification CNNs (convolutional neural network)
